# Blu:Gen – Recycling Impact Tracker (Frontend)

A frontend application for tracking recycling activity and visualizing environmental impact for Blu:Gen, a youth-led waste management initiative focused on reducing plastic waste through behavioral nudges and community engagement.

This repository currently contains **frontend code only**.

---

## Repository scope
This repo includes:
- Frontend UI code for the Blu:Gen recycling tracker
- User-facing components for logging recycling activity
- Impact visualization (e.g. recycling progress and CO₂-related metrics)

Backend services and data persistence are handled separately and are **not included in this repository**.

---

## Authorship & integrity
The frontend code in this repository was independently written by me.

This project was not created by following a step-by-step tutorial or replicating a template application.  
All UI structure, logic flow, and component design decisions were made independently.

Mentorship and technical guidance are credited separately in my Maker Portfolio submission.

## High-level architecture
- Frontend: Flutter
- State management and UI logic handled client-side
- Backend: External services (not included in this repo)

This separation reflects an intentional design choice to allow the frontend to evolve independently of backend implementation.

---

## What the frontend does
- Provides interfaces for users to log recycling activity
- Displays progress indicators and impact metrics
- Visualizes recycling outcomes in a way that encourages continued participation

---
